peopleSearch.php

"Use of undefined constant validationFailed - assumed 'validationFailed"
we see this on peopleSearch.php when trying to wash user input from the searchPeopleLastName text box.
The variable $searchPeopleLastName = "Springer"  (has a value)
but when I try to change the variable name to $searchPeopleLastName_value  and continue to wash the data the value remains "".

        $washPostVar = cleanup_post($_POST['searchPeopleLastName']);
        $searchPeopleLastName_value = strip_before_insert($conn, $washPostVar);
